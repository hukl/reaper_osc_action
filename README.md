# Reaper OSC Action

This is a Elgato StreamDeck Plugin to send Command IDs to the DAW Reaper via OSC. It is written in Go.

Demo Video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTwFpP6xsbU

## Installation

The easiest way to install the plugin is to download the latest release:
`org.smyck.reaper-osc-action.streamDeckPlugin`

After downloading the file, a simple double click on the file should install it
in StreamDeck.

## Building

If you want to build the plugin yourself you should only need to have a working
Go installation and then run `make`

This will also do the cross compilation and create a universal binary.

After this you can symlink the plugin folder to the StreamDeck plugins folder

`ln -s ./org.smyck.reaper_osc_action.sdPlugin ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/`

Restart the StreamDeck app and verify in the Preferences / Plugins tab that
the "Reaper OSC Action" plugin appears.

Then place it on one of the StreamDeck Buttons and add "127.0.0.1" as IO, the
port that was configured in Reaper and a command id of your choice.

You can also build a .streamDeckPlugin file by running:
`make plugin`

You need the cli tools `fd` and `streamdeck`
